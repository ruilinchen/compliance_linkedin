Folder structure that is used throughout the experiment:
* `labelled_data`: where all the hand-coded data goes
* `job_info_data`: where all the scraped raw csv files go
* `data_for_filtering`: where the cleaned raw data + intermediary results from the experiment go
* `compiled_dataset`: where final datasets (cleaned and filtered) go

One file path, `data_for_filtering/job_with_compliance_keywords.csv`, is used throughout the experiment.
This file is generated by applying the preprocessing step to all the raw csv data scraped from Indeed.
It contains all the needed information for training the classifier and compiling the final dataset.
